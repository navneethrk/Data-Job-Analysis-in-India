#📌 **Project Title**

Data Science Job Market Analysis in India (Indeed Web Scraping + SQL + Tableau)

#📖 **Overview**

When searching for internships, I realized how difficult it was to find reliable job postings in India’s data science domain. Many listings are fake, scattered, or lack salary transparency. While global data exists, I wanted to analyze the Indian job market for Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and related internships.

This project uses:
Web Scraping (Indeed job listings)
SQL (MS SQL Server) for cleaning & preprocessing
Tableau for visualization
Final dataset: ~2000 scraped → cleaned to 800 job postings

#📈 **Key Insights**

Data Analyst roles dominate postings, but Data Scientist roles show higher average salaries.
Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Pune lead in job opportunities.
Salaries vary significantly by state, with metro cities offering the highest packages.
Company ratings don’t always correlate with salaries — some high-paying firms have average ratings.

Internships are concentrated in startups and mid-sized firms, often with unclear salary data.
